# APRA Data Science Courses

This project contains the source files and processes for creating the fictitious data for APRAâ€™s fundraising data science online learning courses and workshops. This project was initiated by APRA's Data Science Committee and a subcommittee with the following members developed the approach to developing the data files: 

- Mirabai Auer, University of Chicago
- Barron Cato, University of Washington
- Kate Chamberlin, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
- Michael Pawlus, The Ohio State University
- Rich Majerus, Queens University of Charlotte

The original guidiing shared google document for this project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Q5OgUMnprLiF6E7baLXWvLBTaRbXt077KvrXZ_w33Q/edit). 

The data sets created in this project will be used across a series of online learning programs and courses for APRA for continuity and to enable projects to be cumulative.  

## Files 

### Ficititious Fundraising Data Files

The result of this project is three fundraising data files:

1. bio_data_table.csv - contains hypothetical biographical data about donors. Each row represents a unique donor. 
2. giving_data_table.csv - contains hypothetical gifts made by donors and attributes of the gifts. Each row represents a gift. 
3. engagement_data_table.csv - contains hypothetical information on donors interactions and engagements with a ficititious non-profit organization. 









- The same data set will be used across all courses for continuity and to enable projects to span multiple courses. 
Some courses may only use a subset of the available tables. 
Each data table will be available as a .csv, Excel, and a table in a database. 
There will be three data tables: bio, giving, and prospect/engagement
