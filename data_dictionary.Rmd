## Introduction

This project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/majerus/apra_data_science_courses).

Challenges built in
## Biographical Data

```{r}
# load tidyverse library 
library(tidyverse)

# read in biographical data from .csv file on github
bio <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/majerus/apra_data_science_courses/master/bio_data_table.csv")

```

The biographical data has the following variables:    

- id: A seven digit numeric id that is unique to each donor.  
- name: Each donor's first and last name formatted as "last name, first name".
- household_id: A seven digit numeric id that is unique to households. More than one donor may share a household_id. 
- deceased: A binary indicator that indicates if a donor is deceased ("Y"|"N")
- country: Each donor's country of residence. 
- city: Each donor's city of residence. 
- birthday: The date of each donor's birth stored as a date variable.
- zip: The five digit zipcode of donor's whose country of residence is the United States. 
- state: The two-letter state abbreviation for each donor whose country of residence is the United States. 
- lat: The latitude of the center point of each donor's zipcode. Missing for donor's residing outside the United States.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
